LINUX COMMANDS
================

=====================
Linux Commands basic 
=====================

date & time	= Are we on the right box ? knowing date and time for possible persistence 
Whoami	 = double check who we are logged in as
Id		 = permissions group ( do we have root permissions)
Groups 	= see what groups we are apart of (are we in the sudoers )
sudo -l		= do we have any binaries that execute with higher privs  
cat /etc/passwd	 ( user information)
cat /etc/shadow 	( user information) ( need privileged access)
W  = who is logged in, terminal and what they are doing ( tty  are direct connections to the pc.. So pts are ssh or telnet connections (possible info about other pcs)
Last = information about users that logged in ( user habits ) ( might need to avoid times)
Uptime = how long has the machine been up ( would this make for a good pivot)
Hostname = name of machine ( pay attention)

uname -a 	= kernel information architecture ( for exploits )
cat /etc/*rel* 

=======================
Networking Information
=======================

Ifconfig -a = network information ( verify your on the right target so you don’t go to jail pimp) ( dbo with the size 15 show)
cat /etc/hosts = translates hostnames or domain names to ip addresses ( could see a name to another box, might point a target of interest Windows Server )
cat /etc/resolv.conf = configure dns name servers 
netstat -rn
netstat -antup  ( backdoors and rootkits do use magic packets and udp) ( rsyslog 514 port) programs on different ports we could exploit
arp -an 	= sends data will verify arp cache ( only lasts for a few minutes) passive network enumeration .. Maybe we could find out information about other machines on the network without scanning


===================
Process Information
===================

ps -auxf 	= (a) all processes,  format
Ps -aux | grep syslog* ( just cause it’s running doesn’t mean it’s remotely sending logs)
lsof -p 886 	= list of open files ( files opened by the process ) ( root access can see everything the process is accessing)
lsof -i <4|6> = view files utilizing ip version 
ls -al /proc/886
ls -al /proc/8/fd  = file descriptors ( which is important, last thing we want is tools stolen)
Service --status-all  	=show if services are running or not 

==========
Logging
==========
Cat /etc/rsyslog.conf  = check for remote logging udp port 514 ( can get us caught)
/etc/rsyslog.d 		= directory where config files are kept we want to check those also.
/var/log		=  auth logs, etc
Cat /var/log/auth.log | grep -i successful

========
Crontabs
========

/var/spool/cron/crontabs ( same as crontab -e just without syntax help)
/etc/cron.d
Ls -la /etc/cron*
Cat /etc/cron*  crontab
sudo crontab -u student -l


====================================
Finding files and locations to check
====================================

find / -name password* 2>/dev/null   ( pay attention to file extensions )
find / -type f -name *.txt 	= (possible user generated documents )
find / -type f 2>/dev/null | grep filenamehere
find / -type f -name ".*"   = find all hidden files
find / -type d -name ".*"    = find all hidden directories

/tmp		check tmp folders ( global writable )
/home	 	check home folders for users
/etc = config files are here ( can give you a hint if any extra programs have been installed on the box)


TCP Dump
tcpdump -X -A not port ## ←- your ssh connection port
