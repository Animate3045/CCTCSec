Workflow

Set the appropriate objective - you shouldn't be trying to understand every line of the code out of the gate 

Initial static analysis
    drag and drop to a text file 
        MZ - windows environment
        ELF - linux executable format
    look for ascii strings in the file
    look for encrypted sections

Behavioral Analysis
    How does it run? How does it change the system?
    Snapshots & diff 

Dynamic analysis
    Use a debugger

Disassembly
    IDA: better at graphically displaying the flow of a program
        older
        better debugger 
    Ghidra: open source from the NSA
        has a decompiler function (best attempt) - compiling is a lossy process
        assembly and c code side-by-side
        patching (assembly only) 
    Find a good spot - browse top to bottom/bottom to top

Scientific method - hypothesis, and test
