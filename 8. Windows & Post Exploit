Kernel mode - single virtual address space - not isolate from other processes
    - Ex: drivers
    - when things in kernel space crash = blue screen
User mode - private virtual address space 

DLLs
- registry prioritized to help prevent malicious dlls from loading first

User account controls - may need to bypass (do you have System32 access)

Privilege Escalation
- Actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network

- 

GUI: Task Sch (powershell if you're on the pipeline)
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | Select-String -Pattern "Task to Run" | find /i /v "com Handler"
