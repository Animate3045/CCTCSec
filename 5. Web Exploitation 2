What screws people up - syntax and the way the relational nature interacts with queries

Database -> table -> columns -> rows 
3x default databases
    information_schema
        provides access to database metadata - important for us to build queries
        "we don't give a shit whats actually in this database
    performance_schema
        developer shit 
    mysql
        other user config stuff
    ***WE ARE LOOKING FOR DATABASES THAT ARE NOT ONE OF THESE THREE***

show databases;
use session;
show tables;
describe user;

STANDARD FORM 
select 1,2,3 [will be columns] from database.table
    ex: select * from session.user 
        select id,name,pass from session.user

We are taking advantage of unsanitized input fields 
    single quote ' is used to check and create subsequent clauses
    needs to be straight quote, not curly quote --> must check this, esp when copy/pasta
GET request and POST request are handled differently
    GET - url bar
    POST - search box
    --> should check both because formatting and returned info may be different

SQL methodology
- username and password
- interact normally
- tom' or 1='1
