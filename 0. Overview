real world - use control sockets for tunneling

Methodology
- build dynamic tunnel to jump box
- host discovery
    run for loop from jump box
     other type of for loop: for i in {1..254}; do ping -c 1 192.168.28.$i | grep "bytes from" 
- port enumeration
- port interrogation (banner grab)
- Web Sites
    nmap http-enum script
    robots.txt
    interact with site
    view source
    IF WE COME ACROSS INPUT FIELDS
        Directory Traversal
            ........./etc/passwd -> looking for users with a login shell; also identify that user's root directory
            ........./etc/hosts -> might have additional sites you can reach
        Command Injection 


Forget wget exists after the ftp question today

proxychains nc -vvv 192.168.28.120 4242
